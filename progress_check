I tested a version of my program where ERS could be played via terminal with the computer. 
However, I found that to be very boring and not as engaging as as real game of ERS. I really did not enjoy how the game ran at all.
So instead, I'm going to code it where the cards can be displayed on a screen so the player can visualize the game instead of through the terminal.
I'm still going to keep the classes and functions that I already have. It's just a matter of adding fucntions to display the game on a screen.
This would make it WAY more interactive and fun to play.
In terms of grading myself with the Final Project Rubric, I would say that I meet the concept, project description, approach, and code style.
My project is definitely not at the point where it would fully meet project code, code documentation, or code tests.
So if I submitted my project right now, I would not really have that good of a grade...
I would grade myself 14/21. This is how I calculated that: 1/1, 0/1, 2/2, 4/4, 3/6, 2/2, 1/2, 1/2.
