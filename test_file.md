The way that a user would test the entire functionality would look like this:
The player runs the code and a screen pops up on their computer with a start button on the bottom to initiate the game
The computer would generate a card to place down, and there would be a button for the player to click in order to place down a card
When a player sees that the pile can be slapped, they can click fhe slap buttpn and if fhey beat the computer to it, they get the pile
This would go on and on until either the computer or the player has the whole deck in their hands
